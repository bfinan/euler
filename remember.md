# Things to remember

- Before jumping into the problem, take a moment to think through the solution
- Pay close attention to what the form of the answer is. It may be asking for the sum of the numbers you found, rather than how many of them you found
- leave comments for yourself - you might need to step away from a problem and then come back later
